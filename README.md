# NN_Scratch

Neural network from scratch, implemented with numpy and a lot of patience with calculus and linear algebra, (vectorization and calculating proper gradients are a bitch), recently implemented Gradient checking and Dropout regularization, now focusing on implementing a proper library, which I will be able to use to further understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning,

Performance of a [784,128,128,10] network for MNIST classification with 0.5 learning rate(I have no patience I know) is at 
97% for validation accuracy and 96% for training data accuracy(which means regularization has been properly implemented as it has generalized)
